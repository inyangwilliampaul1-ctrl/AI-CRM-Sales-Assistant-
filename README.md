# AI CRM Sales Assistant

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Real-time sales metrics and overview.
- **Customers**: Manage customer data, history, and engagement.
- **Deals**: Kanban-style deal tracking.
- **Tickets**: Customer support ticket system linked to CRM.
- **AI Power**: Smart summaries, next action recommendations, and message drafting.

### AI Fallback Mode

This application includes a smart AI fallback system.

- When OpenAI API quota is available, real AI responses are used.
- When quota is exceeded or API is unavailable, the app switches to **Simulation Mode**.
- Simulation Mode returns realistic mock AI responses to allow full UI and UX testing.

This ensures reliability, demo safety, and uninterrupted user experience.
